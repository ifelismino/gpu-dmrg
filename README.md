# gpu-dmrg
A code repositoory of the (now outdated) study of GPU-Accelerated DMRG using a modified version of Leo GiggleLiu's Jacobi Davidson code. The code for the DMRG Algorithm itself is based on James R. Garrison and Ryan V. Mishmash's simple-dmrg.

Requirements for running the code:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- PyCuda
- cuda-cffi (discontinued)

The study results paper is the bulk of my undergraduate thesis and was written under the supervision of my adviser, Francis Paraan PhD
